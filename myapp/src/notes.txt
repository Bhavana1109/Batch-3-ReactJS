Single page applications-no refreshing, no reloading

multi page application-refreshing,reloading will happen

-React is mainly used to create a single page application.

what is virtual DOM?
-Virtual DOM is a virtual representation of a UI which is kept in a memory later synced(mapping) with 
real DOM with the help of a library called "ReactDOM".

-The updation of real dom with virtual DOM.

-The entire process of updating the realDOM with the help of VDOM is called as"Reconcialities"

JSX:'
******
-JSX stands for Javascript and XML
-JSX is a Javascript syntax extension used to create HTML-like markup in the react.
-Actual way to create a element in react is by using a method called as,
  -React.createElement("tagname",{property:"value"}/null, content/children)
let ele=React.createElement("div",{className:"App"},
    React.createElement("h1",null,"Header")
  );

-JSX is not a part of react but it is recommend to use in react.

Rules of JSX:-
***************
1. every element irrespective of paired/unpaired tag both must be closed.
ex;- <h1></h1> , <input/>
2.more than one jsx element is used then they must wrapped with one parent elememt.
ex;- <div>
<h1></h1>
<p></p>
</div>

JSX expression:-
-JSX expression is used to call the varaible, mathematical expression inside the elememt.
synatx:- <h1>{varaible/expression}</h1>

components:-
************
-components are the files /modules which consist of js related logics which can be reuse.
1.class based components(CBC)
2.functional based components(FBC)

1.class based components(CBC):-
*******************************
- CBC is simlar to javscript es6 class.
- CBC are "statefull" component because of default  state object present inside the class.
syntax:-

 class Person{
    constructor(name , age){
        this.name=name;
        this.age=age;
    }
 }

class Child extends Person{
    constructor(name , age , city){
        super(name , age);
        this.city=city;
    }
}

syntax :- 
class App extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return(
            //JSX
        )
    }
}
export default App;

2.functional based component:-
******************************
- FBC are similar to JS functions.
- FBC are "stateless" because there is no state object untill react v16.8.

syntax :-  function App(){
                return(

                )
            }
            export default App;

            OR
            const App=()=>{
                return(
                    //jsx
                )
            }
            export default App;

Notee :- while ctreating a react compoennt the names must be started with capital letters.
- extension of a component file must be .jsx/.js
- How to call a component.
    <App/> / <App></App>


component composition:-
***********************
-component composition is used to combine multiple components into single application.

shortcuts:
to create class component-rcc
arrow function -rafce

Props:-
*********
- props is nothing but a properties similar to html attributes.
- props is an object.
- props is an object used to exchange information/data from parent component to child component.

React.Fragments:-
*******************
-this will act as a parent element for the jsx elements and we can give key prop for this.

3.useRef():-
************
- ref is used to target native/real DOM elements.

4. useContext():-
*******************
-to avoid props drilling we context api
